            <h1>Android Macost Story</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices in the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly mascot has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this robot.</p>

            <h2>The First Version</h2>

            <p>
                The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2013/01/04/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascots-that-could-have-been/" target="_blanck">Dan Morril</a>. He says that he opened the <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt/" target="_blanck">Inkscape</a>(Free and open source software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot.
                The goal was just to personify the system just for your team,  there was no  request from the company to create a mascot
            </p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was  even named in honor of its creator: to be <strong>Dandroids</strong></p>

            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of ​​having a mascot for maturing and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. The illustrator Russian <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blanck">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flattering way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with which viewer. Then came about the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new mascot of Android.</p>

            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class= "pq" alt="BugDroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the strokes of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating on her desk at Google's office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                <p>Another curious subject about Android is that each version has always been named after candy, alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>

                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>

                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, the<strong> Android Q</strong> did not exist, because Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and began to use numbering, which gave rise to the Android 10.</p>
